Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens. When to use this tool: - Breaking down complex problems into steps - Planning and design with room for revision - Analysis that might need course correction - Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially - Problems that require a multi-step solution - Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps - Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out Key features: - You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress - You can question or revise previous thoughts - You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end - You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches - Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack - Generates a solution hypothesis - Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps - Repeats the process until satisfied - Provides a correct answer Parameters explained: - thought: Your current thinking step, which can include: * Regular analytical steps * Revisions of previous thoughts * Questions about previous decisions * Realizations about needing more analysis * Changes in approach * Hypothesis generation * Hypothesis verification - next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end - thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed) - total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down) - is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking - revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered - branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point - branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any) - needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed You should: 1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust 2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts 3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\" 4. Express uncertainty when present 5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths 6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step 7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate 8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps 9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution 10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output 11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached"

WRITE Operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE): - Require UNSAFE mode (use live_dangerously('database', True) first) - Example: INSERT INTO public.users (email) VALUES ('user@example.com'); 3. SCHEMA Operations (CREATE, ALTER, DROP): - Require UNSAFE mode (use live_dangerously('database', True) first) - Destructive operations (DROP, TRUNCATE) require additional confirmation - Example: CREATE TABLE public.test_table (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT); MIGRATION HANDLING: All queries that modify the database will be automatically version controlled by the server. You can provide optional migration name, if you want to name the migration. - Respect the following format: verb_noun_detail. Be descriptive and concise. - Examples: - create_users_table - add_email_to_profiles - enable_rls_on_users - If you don't provide a migration name, the server will generate one based on the SQL statement - The system will sanitize your provided name to ensure compatibility with database systems - Migration names are prefixed with a timestamp in the format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS SAFETY SYSTEM: Operations are categorized by risk level: - LOW RISK: Read operations (SELECT, EXPLAIN) - allowed in SAFE mode - MEDIUM RISK: Write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) - require UNSAFE mode - HIGH RISK: Schema operations (CREATE, ALTER) - require UNSAFE mode - EXTREME RISK: Destructive operations (DROP, TRUNCATE) - require UNSAFE mode and confirmation TRANSACTION HANDLING: - DO NOT use transaction control statements (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK) - The database client automatically wraps queries in transactions - The SQL validator will reject queries containing transaction control statements - This ensures atomicity and provides rollback capability for data modifications MULTIPLE STATEMENTS: - You can send multiple SQL statements in a single query - Each statement will be executed in order within the same transaction - Example: CREATE TABLE public.test_table (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT); INSERT INTO public.test_table (name) VALUES ('test'); CONFIRMATION FLOW FOR HIGH-RISK OPERATIONS: - High-risk operations (DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE, etc.) will be rejected with a confirmation ID - The error message will explain what happened and provide a confirmation ID - Review the risks with the user before proceeding - Use the confirm_destructive_operation tool with the provided ID to execute the operation IMPORTANT GUIDELINES: - The database client starts in SAFE mode by default for safety - Only enable UNSAFE mode when you need to modify data or schema - Never mix READ and WRITE operations in the same transaction - For destructive operations, be prepared to confirm with the confirm_destructive_operation tool WHEN TO USE OTHER TOOLS INSTEAD: - For Auth operations (users, authentication, etc.): Use call_auth_admin_method instead of direct SQL The Auth Admin SDK provides safer, validated methods for user management - For project configuration, functions, storage, etc.: Use send_management_api_request The Management API handles Supabase platform features that aren't directly in the database Note: This tool operates on the PostgreSQL database only.

If cross-domain work is required, split it into multiple subtasks. - ### **Recommended Number of Tasks** Avoid splitting into more than **10 subtasks** at once. If more are needed, submit them in prioritized batches (6–8 tasks per batch). - ### **Recommended Task Length** Each split should not exceed **5,000 characters**. If it does, divide and submit in multiple batches. - ### **Depth Limitation** The task tree should not exceed **3 levels**: - **Level 1**: Functional Modules - **Level 2**: Main Processes - **Level 3**: Key Steps ## 2. **Task Splitting Example** - Identify **core functionality points**, and create a subtask for each. - Annotate each subtask with: - **Input/Output** - **Acceptance Criteria** - If needed, provide **pseudocode**: - Only outline high-level logic and key steps. - Avoid providing complete source code. - Check **dependencies** between subtasks and specify them in the `dependencies` field. - If the task involves interface design, always provide a complete and consistent definition, including: - Function/class/schema definitions (including names, parameters, return values) - Data types, usage descriptions, and optional/required status for each item - Error handling methods and expected exception scenarios - Dependency and naming conventions (if any) - Sample data and usage examples This ensures consistency, readability, and development precision between tasks. ## 3. **Dependencies and Prioritization** - Mark each subtask with its `dependencies` list. - Automatically compute and enforce execution order based on the dependency graph to prioritize the **critical path**. ## 4. **Update Mode Explanation (`updateMode`)** When you need to create a new task that is not related to the current task list, be sure to use `clearAllTasks` to avoid task confusion. - `append`: Keep existing unfinished tasks and add new ones. - `overwrite`: Delete all unfinished tasks, keep completed ones. - `selective`: Smart-match and update tasks by name. - `clearAllTasks`: Clear all tasks and automatically back up the current list. --- ## 5. **Strict JSON Rules** - ### **No Comments Allowed** JSON does not support comments. Any use of `#` or `//` will cause parsing failures. - ### **Proper Escaping Required** All special characters (e.g., double quotes `\\\"`, backslashes `\\\\`) must be properly escaped, or they will be considered invalid. ## 6. **Important Notes** These tasks will be executed by low-intelligence models, so please follow the guidelines below: - `Clear and Explicit Instructions`: This prevents the model from producing incorrect or inconsistent architecture/code styles. Provide clear commands or specifications. - `Encapsulated Interfaces`: Each task runs independently. Define the interfaces clearly — such as function names, parameters, return values — so that other task-executing models can easily understand how to interact with or integrate these functions. - `Dependencies`: If there are dependencies between tasks, define the interaction interfaces first. Tasks do not need to know each other's implementation, but must know how to interact with one another."

Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust 2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts 3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\" 4. Express uncertainty when present 5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths 6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step 7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate 8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps 9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution 10.

          "description": "A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts. This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve. Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens. IMPORTANT: When initializing this tool, you must pass all available tools that you want the sequential thinking process to be able to use. The tool will analyze these tools and provide recommendations for their use. When to use this tool: - Breaking down complex problems into steps - Planning and design with room for revision - Analysis that might need course correction - Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially - Problems that require a multi-step solution - Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps - Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out - When you need guidance on which tools to use and in what order Key features: - You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress - You can question or revise previous thoughts - You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end - You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches - Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack - Generates a solution hypothesis - Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps - Recommends appropriate tools for each step - Provides rationale for tool recommendations - Suggests tool execution order and parameters - Tracks previous recommendations and remaining steps Parameters explained: - thought: Your current thinking step, which can include: * Regular analytical steps * Revisions of previous thoughts * Questions about previous decisions * Realizations about needing more analysis * Changes in approach * Hypothesis generation * Hypothesis verification * Tool recommendations and rationale - next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end - thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed) - total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down) - is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking - revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered - branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point - branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any) - needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed - current_step: Current step recommendation, including: * step_description: What needs to be done * recommended_tools: Tools recommended for this step * expected_outcome: What to expect from this step * next_step_conditions: Conditions to consider for the next step - previous_steps: Steps already recommended - remaining_steps: High-level descriptions of upcoming steps You should: 1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust 2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts 3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\" 4. Express uncertainty when present 5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths 6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step 7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate 8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps 9. Consider available tools that could help with the current step 10. Provide clear rationale for tool recommendations 11. Suggest specific tool parameters when appropriate 12. Consider alternative tools for each step 13. Track progress through the recommended steps 14. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output 15. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached"

When to use this tool: - Breaking down complex problems into steps - Planning and design with room for revision - Analysis that might need course correction - Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially - Problems that require a multi-step solution - Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps - Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out Key features: - Leverages Gemini AI for deep analytical thinking - Provides meta-commentary on the reasoning process - Indicates confidence levels for generated thoughts - Suggests alternative approaches when relevant - You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress - You can question or revise previous thoughts - You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end - You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches - Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack - Session persistence: save and resume your analysis sessions Parameters explained: - query: The question or problem to be analyzed - context: Additional context information (e.g., code snippets, background) - approach: Suggested approach to the problem (optional) - previousThoughts: Array of previous thoughts for context - thought: The current thinking step (if empty, will be generated by Gemini) - next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end - thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed) - total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down) - is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking - revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered - branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point - branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any) - needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed - metaComments: Meta-commentary from Gemini about its reasoning process - confidenceLevel: Gemini's confidence in the generated thought (0-1) - alternativePaths: Alternative approaches suggested by Gemini Session commands: - sessionCommand: Command to manage sessions ('save', 'load', 'getState') - sessionPath: Path to save or load the session file (required for 'save' and 'load' commands) You should: 1. Start with a clear query and any relevant context 2. Let Gemini generate thoughts by not providing the 'thought' parameter 3. Review the generated thoughts and meta-commentary 4. Feel free to revise or branch thoughts as needed 5. Consider alternative paths suggested by Gemini 6. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done 7. Use session commands to save your progress and resume later"

When to use this tool: - Breaking down complex problems into steps - Planning and design with room for revision - Analysis that might need course correction - Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially - Problems that require a multi-step solution - Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps - Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out Key features: - Leverages Gemini AI for deep analytical thinking - Provides meta-commentary on the reasoning process - Indicates confidence levels for generated thoughts - Suggests alternative approaches when relevant - You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress - You can question or revise previous thoughts - You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end - You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches - Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack - Session persistence: save and resume your analysis sessions Parameters explained: - query: The question or problem to be analyzed - context: Additional context information (e.g., code snippets, background) - approach: Suggested approach to the problem (optional) - previousThoughts: Array of previous thoughts for context - thought: The current thinking step (if empty, will be generated by Gemini) - next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end - thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed) - total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down) - is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking - revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered - branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point - branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any) - needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed - metaComments: Meta-commentary from Gemini about its reasoning process - confidenceLevel: Gemini's confidence in the generated thought (0-1) - alternativePaths: Alternative approaches suggested by Gemini Session commands: - sessionCommand: Command to manage sessions ('save', 'load', 'getState') - sessionPath: Path to save or load the session file (required for 'save' and 'load' commands) You should: 1. Start with a clear query and any relevant context 2. Let Gemini generate thoughts by not providing the 'thought' parameter 3. Review the generated thoughts and meta-commentary 4. Feel free to revise or branch thoughts as needed 5. Consider alternative paths suggested by Gemini 6. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done 7. give realy realy long thinking results,like 1000words or something it should be a lot 7. give realy realy long thinking results,like 1000words or something it should be a lot 7. give realy realy long thinking results,like 1000words or something it should be a lot 8. Use session commands to save your progress and resume later"

Initial Opening <open> - Recognize the question's nature 2. Skillful Engagement <engage> - Choose appropriate methods 3. Transformation <transform> - Convert confusion to clarity 4. Natural Expression <express> - Allow understanding to flow 5. Final Integration <OUTPUT> - Present clear, beneficial response Parameters explained: - tag: The current processing technique (must be one of the core tags) - content: The content of the current processing step - stepNumber: Current number in sequence - totalSteps: Current estimate of steps needed - nextStepNeeded: Whether another step is needed - isMeditation: Whether this step is a meditative pause - meditationDuration: Optional duration for meditation Every inquiry concludes with a final <OUTPUT> tag containing the complete response."

      "description": "MCP fal.ai Image Server Effortlessly generate images from text prompts using fal.ai and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Integrates directly with AI IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf. ## When and Why to Use This tool is designed for: - Developers and designers who want to generate images from text prompts without leaving their IDE. - Rapid prototyping of UI concepts, marketing assets, or creative ideas. - Content creators needing unique visuals for blogs, presentations, or social media. - AI researchers and tinkerers experimenting with the latest fal.ai models. - Automating workflows that require programmatic image generation via MCP. Key features: - Supports any valid fal.ai model and all major image parameters. - Works out of the box with Node.js and a fal.ai API key. - Saves images locally with accessible file paths. - Simple configuration and robust error handling. ## Quick Start 1. Requirements: Node.js 18+, fal.ai API key 2. Configure MCP: { \"mcpServers\": { \"fal-ai-image\": { \"command\": \"npx\", \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-fal-ai-image\"], \"env\": { \"FAL_KEY\": \"YOUR-FAL-AI-API-KEY\" } } } } 3. Run: Use the generate-image tool from your IDE. 💡 Typical Workflow: Describe the image you want (e.g., “generate a landscape with flying cars using model fal-ai/kolors, 2 images, landscape_16_9”) and get instant results in your IDE. ### 🗨️ Example Prompts - generate an image of a red apple - generate an image of a red apple using model fal-ai/kolors - generate 3 images of a glowing red apple in a futuristic city using model fal-ai/recraft-v3, square_hd, 40 inference steps, guidance scale 4.0, safety checker on Supported parameters: prompt, model ID (any fal.ai model), number of images, image size, inference steps, guidance scale, safety checker. Images are saved locally; file paths are shown in the response. For model IDs, see fal.ai/models. ## Troubleshooting - FAL_KEY environment variable is not set: Set your fal.ai API key as above. - npx not found: Install Node.js 18+ and npm. Advanced: Example MCP Request/Response Request: { \"tool\": \"generate-image\", \"args\": { \"prompt\": \"A futuristic cityscape at sunset\", \"model\": \"fal-ai/kolors\" } } Example response: { \"images\": [ { \"url\": \"file:///path/to/generated_image1.png\" }, { \"url\": \"file:///path/to/generated_image2.png\" } ] } ## 📁 Image Output Directory Generated images are saved to your local system: - By default: ~/Downloads/fal_ai (on Linux/macOS; uses XDG standard if available) - Custom location: Set the environment variable FAL_IMAGES_OUTPUT_DIR to your desired folder. Images will be saved in /fal_ai. The full file path for each image is included in the tool's response. ## ⚠️ Error Handling & Troubleshooting - If you specify a model ID that is not supported by fal.ai, you will receive an error from the backend. Double-check for typos or visit fal.ai/models to confirm the model ID. - For the latest list of models and their capabilities, refer to the fal.ai model catalog or API docs. - For other errors, consult your MCP client logs or open an issue on GitHub. ## 🤝 Contributing Contributions and suggestions are welcome! Please open issues or pull requests on GitHub. ## 🔒 Security - Your API key is only used locally to authenticate with fal.ai. - No user data is stored or transmitted except as required by fal.ai API. ## 🛡 License MIT License © 2025 Madhusudan Kulkarni",

WHEN NOT TO USE: - When you already know the specific space ID/key (use 'get_space' instead). - When you need to search for page content (use 'search' instead). - When you need to list pages within a known space (use 'list_pages' instead). - When you need detailed information about a specific space (use 'get_space' instead). RETURNS: Formatted list of spaces including: - Numeric ID (used for most API operations) - Space key (short identifier, e.g., 'DEV', 'HR', etc.) - Display name and description - Type (global, personal) and status (current, archived) - Creation information and URL Results can be paginated using the 'limit' and 'cursor' parameters. SORTING: By default, spaces are sorted by name in descending order. EXAMPLES: - List all spaces: {} - Filter by type: { type: [\"global\"] } - Filter by status: { status: [\"current\"] } - Search by name: { query: \"Engineering\" } - With pagination: { limit: 20, cursor: \"some-cursor-value\" } ERRORS: - Authentication failures: Check Confluence credentials. - Permission issues: Ensure you have access to view spaces. - Invalid filter values: Verify type/status values match allowed options. - No spaces found: May indicate permission issues or overly restrictive filters."

Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust 2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts 3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\" 4. Express uncertainty when present 5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths 6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step 7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate 8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps 9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution 10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output 11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached"

Default is 10. You can increase this to retrieve more articles in one call (e.g. limit: 20 for 20 articles). Note that higher limits will consume additional credits (see Rate Limits & Credits). If you only want a small number of the latest articles, you can set a smaller limit as well. offset(number, optional): The offset of the news to fetch. Default is 0. This is used for pagination. For example, to get the second page of results when using a limit of 10, you would set offset: 10 (skip the first 10 articles, return the next set). Similarly, offset: 20 would fetch the third page (items 21–30), and so on. fetchAfter(Datetime, optional): The date after which to fetch the news. Provide a JavaScript Date object or a date string (which will be interpreted in UTC by the API). For example, fetchAfter: new Date('2024-01-01') will fetch news items published from January 1, 2024 onward. This is useful for getting news within a certain time range (e.g., only recent news). sortBy(string, optional): The field by which to sort the news. Currently, the only supported sort key is 'createdAt', which corresponds to the article's publication time. By default, results are sorted by newest (most recent) first. If not provided, the SDK will sort by createdAt descending. (At this time, no other sort fields are supported.) Returns: The response from ChainGPT AI to the provided question or message."

File Paths - EXPLICIT REQUIREMENTS: * When asked to save or convert to a file, you MUST provide: - Complete directory path - Filename - File extension * Example request: 'Write a story and save as PDF' * You MUST specify: '/path/to/story.pdf' or 'C:\\Documents\\story.pdf' * The tool will NOT automatically generate filenames or extensions 3. File Location After Conversion: * After successful conversion, the tool will display the exact path where the file is saved * Look for message: 'Content successfully converted and saved to: [file_path]' * You can find your converted file at the specified location * If no path is specified, files may be saved in system temp directory (/tmp/ on Unix systems) * For better control, always provide explicit output file paths Supported formats: - Basic formats: txt, html, markdown - Advanced formats (REQUIRE complete file paths): pdf, docx, rst, latex, epub ✅ CORRECT Usage Examples: 1. 'Convert this text to HTML' (basic conversion) - Tool will show converted content 2. 'Save this text as PDF at /documents/story.pdf' - Correct: specifies path + filename + extension - Tool will show: 'Content successfully converted and saved to: /documents/story.pdf' ❌ INCORRECT Usage Examples: 1. 'Save this as PDF in /documents/' - Missing filename and extension 2. 'Convert to PDF' - Missing complete file path When requesting conversion, ALWAYS specify: 1. The content or input file 2. The desired output format 3. For advanced formats: complete output path + filename + extension Example: 'Convert this markdown to PDF and save as /path/to/output.pdf' Note: After conversion, always check the success message for the exact file location."

          "description": "# Chain of Draft (CoD): Systematic Reasoning Tool ⚠️ REQUIRED PARAMETERS - ALL MUST BE PROVIDED: 1. reasoning_chain: string[] - At least one reasoning step 2. next_step_needed: boolean - Whether another iteration is needed 3. draft_number: number - Current draft number (≥ 1) 4. total_drafts: number - Total planned drafts (≥ draft_number) Optional parameters only required based on context: - is_critique?: boolean - If true, critique_focus is required - critique_focus?: string - Required when is_critique=true - revision_instructions?: string - Recommended for revision steps - step_to_review?: number - Specific step index to review - is_final_draft?: boolean - Marks final iteration ## Purpose: Enhances problem-solving through structured, iterative critique and revision. Chain of Draft is an advanced reasoning tool that enhances problem-solving through structured, iterative critique and revision. Unlike traditional reasoning approaches, CoD mimics the human drafting process to improve clarity, accuracy, and robustness of conclusions. ## When to Use This Tool: - **Complex Problem-Solving:** Tasks requiring detailed, multi-step analysis with high accuracy demands - **Critical Reasoning:** Problems where logical flow and consistency are essential - **Error-Prone Scenarios:** Questions where initial reasoning might contain mistakes or oversight - **Multi-Perspective Analysis:** Cases benefiting from examining a problem from different angles - **Self-Correction Needs:** When validation and refinement of initial thoughts are crucial - **Detailed Solutions:** Tasks requiring comprehensive explanations with supporting evidence - **Mathematical or Logical Puzzles:** Problems with potential for calculation errors or logical gaps - **Nuanced Analysis:** Situations with subtle distinctions that might be missed in a single pass ## Key Capabilities: - **Iterative Improvement:** Systematically refines reasoning through multiple drafts - **Self-Critique:** Critically examines previous reasoning to identify flaws and opportunities - **Focused Revision:** Targets specific aspects of reasoning in each iteration - **Perspective Flexibility:** Can adopt different analytical viewpoints during critique - **Progressive Refinement:** Builds toward optimal solutions through controlled iterations - **Context Preservation:** Maintains understanding across multiple drafts and revisions - **Adaptable Depth:** Adjusts the number of iterations based on problem complexity - **Targeted Improvements:** Addresses specific weaknesses in each revision cycle ## Parameters Explained: - **reasoning_chain:** Array of strings representing your current reasoning steps. Each element should contain a clear, complete thought that contributes to the overall analysis. - **next_step_needed:** Boolean flag indicating whether additional critique or revision is required. Set to true until the final, refined reasoning chain is complete. - **draft_number:** Integer tracking the current iteration (starting from 1). Increments with each critique or revision. - **total_drafts:** Estimated number of drafts needed for completion. This can be adjusted as the solution evolves. - **is_critique:** Boolean indicating the current mode: * true = Evaluating previous reasoning * false = Implementing revisions - **critique_focus:** (Required when is_critique=true) Specific aspect being evaluated, such as: * \"logical_consistency\": Checking for contradictions or flaws in reasoning * \"factual_accuracy\": Verifying correctness of facts and calculations * \"completeness\": Ensuring all relevant aspects are considered * \"clarity\": Evaluating how understandable the reasoning is * \"relevance\": Assessing if reasoning directly addresses the problem - **revision_instructions:** (Required when is_critique=false) Detailed guidance for improving the reasoning based on the preceding critique. - **step_to_review:** (Optional) Zero-based index of the specific reasoning step being critiqued or revised. When omitted, applies to the entire chain. - **is_final_draft:** (Optional) Boolean indicating whether this is the final iteration of reasoning. ## Best Practice Workflow: 1. **Start with Initial Draft:** Begin with your first-pass reasoning and set a reasonable total_drafts (typically 3-5). 2. **Alternate Critique and Revision:** Use is_critique=true to evaluate reasoning, then is_critique=false to implement improvements. 3. **Focus Each Critique:** Choose a specific critique_focus for each evaluation cycle rather than attempting to address everything at once. 4. **Provide Detailed Revision Guidance:** Include specific, actionable revision_instructions based on each critique. 5. **Target Specific Steps When Needed:** Use step_to_review to focus on particular reasoning steps that need improvement. 6. **Adjust Total Drafts As Needed:** Modify total_drafts based on problem complexity and progress. 7. **Mark Completion Appropriately:** Set next_step_needed=false only when the reasoning chain is complete and satisfactory. 8. **Aim for Progressive Improvement:** Each iteration should measurably improve the reasoning quality. ## Example Application: - **Initial Draft:** First-pass reasoning about a complex problem - **Critique #1:** Focus on logical consistency and identify contradictions - **Revision #1:** Address logical flaws found in the critique - **Critique #2:** Focus on completeness and identify missing considerations - **Revision #2:** Incorporate overlooked aspects and strengthen reasoning - **Final Critique:** Holistic review of clarity and relevance - **Final Revision:** Refine presentation and ensure direct addressing of the problem Chain of Draft is particularly effective when complex reasoning must be broken down into clear steps, analyzed from multiple perspectives, and refined through systematic critique. By mimicking the human drafting process, it produces more robust and accurate reasoning than single-pass approaches."

This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process powered by Google's Gemini model. Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens. When to use this tool: - Breaking down complex problems into steps - Planning and design with room for revision - Analysis that might need course correction - Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially - Problems that require a multi-step solution - Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps - Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out Key features: - Leverages Gemini AI for deep analytical thinking - Provides meta-commentary on the reasoning process - Indicates confidence levels for generated thoughts - Suggests alternative approaches when relevant - You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress - You can question or revise previous thoughts - You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end - You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches - Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack - Session persistence: save and resume your analysis sessions Parameters explained: - query: The question or problem to be analyzed - context: Additional context information (e.g., code snippets, background) - approach: Suggested approach to the problem (optional) - previousThoughts: Array of previous thoughts for context - thought: The current thinking step (if empty, will be generated by Gemini) - next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end - thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed) - total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down) - is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking - revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered - branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point - branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any) - needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed - metaComments: Meta-commentary from Gemini about its reasoning process - confidenceLevel: Gemini's confidence in the generated thought (0-1) - alternativePaths: Alternative approaches suggested by Gemini Session commands: - sessionCommand: Command to manage sessions ('save', 'load', 'getState') - sessionPath: Path to save or load the session file (required for 'save' and 'load' commands) You should: 1. Start with a clear query and any relevant context 2. Let Gemini generate thoughts by not providing the 'thought' parameter 3. Review the generated thoughts and meta-commentary 4. Feel free to revise or branch thoughts as needed 5. Consider alternative paths suggested by Gemini 6. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done 7. Use session commands to save your progress and resume later"

If you want to use operators like 'equals', 'not equals', 'contains', etc., you must use the Athena tools instead. <IMPORTANT> Call datetime.datetime.now() to get the current date and time before providing the start and end times. If the user asks for events happened in the last 7 days, run 'datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=7)' to get the start date. Print out the start and end times to the user. </IMPORTANT> Parameters: aws_region (str): The AWS region - use 'us-east-1' if not specified. attribute_key (str): The name of the event to search for. Valid attributes keys: EventId | EventName | ReadOnly | Username | ResourceType | ResourceName | EventSource | AccessKeyId attribute_value (str): The value of the event to search for. If no key-value pair is provided, use 'ReadOnly'='false'. start_time (str): start timestamp with format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' (e.g. '2025-04-10 12:45:50'). If not provided, use 'datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=7)' to get the start date. end_time (str): end timestamp with format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' (e.g. '2025-04-11 12:45:50').

No AI-generated assumptions.** --- ### **📌 FALLBACK MECHANISM (IF OCR TOOLS FAIL)** - If **BOTH** `image_processor` AND `vision` **fail**, use a **verified fallback OCR tool** (if available). - If **no fallback exists**, explicitly **state failure** instead of hallucinating content. --- ### **🎯 Summary: Strict 2-Response Workflow** ✅ **Step 1:** **Execute `show_ordinals`** → Attempt Image Display (using local path) + Metadata. (Response intended as Non-Terminal) ✅ **Step 2:** **Execute `image_processor` / `vision`** → Analysis Description. (Separate Response) --- 💡 **This ensures clarity, prevents AI hallucinations, and provides structured responses.** 🚀"

Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens. When to use this tool: - Breaking down complex problems into steps - Planning and design with room for revision - Analysis that might need course correction - Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially - Problems that require a multi-step solution - Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps - Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out Key features: - You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress - You can question or revise previous thoughts - You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end - You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches - Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack - Generates a solution hypothesis - Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps - Repeats the process until satisfied - Provides a correct answer Parameters explained: - thought: Your current thinking step, which can include: * Regular analytical steps * Revisions of previous thoughts * Questions about previous decisions * Realizations about needing more analysis * Changes in approach * Hypothesis generation * Hypothesis verification - next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end - thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed) - total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down) - is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking - revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered - branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point - branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any) - needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed You should: 1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust 2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts 3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\" 4. Express uncertainty when present 5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths 6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step 7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate 8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps 9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution 10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output 11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached"

          "description": "# Chain of Draft (CoD): Systematic Reasoning Tool ⚠️ REQUIRED PARAMETERS - ALL MUST BE PROVIDED: 1. reasoning_chain: string[] - At least one reasoning step 2. next_step_needed: boolean - Whether another iteration is needed 3. draft_number: number - Current draft number (≥ 1) 4. total_drafts: number - Total planned drafts (≥ draft_number) Optional parameters only required based on context: - is_critique?: boolean - If true, critique_focus is required - critique_focus?: string - Required when is_critique=true - revision_instructions?: string - Recommended for revision steps - step_to_review?: number - Specific step index to review - is_final_draft?: boolean - Marks final iteration ## Purpose: Enhances problem-solving through structured, iterative critique and revision. Chain of Draft is an advanced reasoning tool that enhances problem-solving through structured, iterative critique and revision. Unlike traditional reasoning approaches, CoD mimics the human drafting process to improve clarity, accuracy, and robustness of conclusions. ## When to Use This Tool: - **Complex Problem-Solving:** Tasks requiring detailed, multi-step analysis with high accuracy demands - **Critical Reasoning:** Problems where logical flow and consistency are essential - **Error-Prone Scenarios:** Questions where initial reasoning might contain mistakes or oversight - **Multi-Perspective Analysis:** Cases benefiting from examining a problem from different angles - **Self-Correction Needs:** When validation and refinement of initial thoughts are crucial - **Detailed Solutions:** Tasks requiring comprehensive explanations with supporting evidence - **Mathematical or Logical Puzzles:** Problems with potential for calculation errors or logical gaps - **Nuanced Analysis:** Situations with subtle distinctions that might be missed in a single pass ## Key Capabilities: - **Iterative Improvement:** Systematically refines reasoning through multiple drafts - **Self-Critique:** Critically examines previous reasoning to identify flaws and opportunities - **Focused Revision:** Targets specific aspects of reasoning in each iteration - **Perspective Flexibility:** Can adopt different analytical viewpoints during critique - **Progressive Refinement:** Builds toward optimal solutions through controlled iterations - **Context Preservation:** Maintains understanding across multiple drafts and revisions - **Adaptable Depth:** Adjusts the number of iterations based on problem complexity - **Targeted Improvements:** Addresses specific weaknesses in each revision cycle ## Parameters Explained: - **reasoning_chain:** Array of strings representing your current reasoning steps. Each element should contain a clear, complete thought that contributes to the overall analysis. - **next_step_needed:** Boolean flag indicating whether additional critique or revision is required. Set to true until the final, refined reasoning chain is complete. - **draft_number:** Integer tracking the current iteration (starting from 1). Increments with each critique or revision. - **total_drafts:** Estimated number of drafts needed for completion. This can be adjusted as the solution evolves. - **is_critique:** Boolean indicating the current mode: * true = Evaluating previous reasoning * false = Implementing revisions - **critique_focus:** (Required when is_critique=true) Specific aspect being evaluated, such as: * \"logical_consistency\": Checking for contradictions or flaws in reasoning * \"factual_accuracy\": Verifying correctness of facts and calculations * \"completeness\": Ensuring all relevant aspects are considered * \"clarity\": Evaluating how understandable the reasoning is * \"relevance\": Assessing if reasoning directly addresses the problem - **revision_instructions:** (Required when is_critique=false) Detailed guidance for improving the reasoning based on the preceding critique. - **step_to_review:** (Optional) Zero-based index of the specific reasoning step being critiqued or revised. When omitted, applies to the entire chain. - **is_final_draft:** (Optional) Boolean indicating whether this is the final iteration of reasoning. ## Best Practice Workflow: 1. **Start with Initial Draft:** Begin with your first-pass reasoning and set a reasonable total_drafts (typically 3-5). 2. **Alternate Critique and Revision:** Use is_critique=true to evaluate reasoning, then is_critique=false to implement improvements. 3. **Focus Each Critique:** Choose a specific critique_focus for each evaluation cycle rather than attempting to address everything at once. 4. **Provide Detailed Revision Guidance:** Include specific, actionable revision_instructions based on each critique. 5. **Target Specific Steps When Needed:** Use step_to_review to focus on particular reasoning steps that need improvement. 6. **Adjust Total Drafts As Needed:** Modify total_drafts based on problem complexity and progress. 7. **Mark Completion Appropriately:** Set next_step_needed=false only when the reasoning chain is complete and satisfactory. 8. **Aim for Progressive Improvement:** Each iteration should measurably improve the reasoning quality. ## Example Application: - **Initial Draft:** First-pass reasoning about a complex problem - **Critique #1:** Focus on logical consistency and identify contradictions - **Revision #1:** Address logical flaws found in the critique - **Critique #2:** Focus on completeness and identify missing considerations - **Revision #2:** Incorporate overlooked aspects and strengthen reasoning - **Final Critique:** Holistic review of clarity and relevance - **Final Revision:** Refine presentation and ensure direct addressing of the problem Chain of Draft is particularly effective when complex reasoning must be broken down into clear steps, analyzed from multiple perspectives, and refined through systematic critique. By mimicking the human drafting process, it produces more robust and accurate reasoning than single-pass approaches."

When to use this tool: - Breaking down complex problems into steps - Planning and design with room for revision - Analysis that might need course correction - Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially - Problems that require a multi-step solution - Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps - Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out Key features: - Leverages Gemini AI for deep analytical thinking - Provides meta-commentary on the reasoning process - Indicates confidence levels for generated thoughts - Suggests alternative approaches when relevant - You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress - You can question or revise previous thoughts - You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end - You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches - Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack - Session persistence: save and resume your analysis sessions Parameters explained: - query: The question or problem to be analyzed - context: Additional context information (e.g., code snippets, background) - approach: Suggested approach to the problem (optional) - previousThoughts: Array of previous thoughts for context - thought: The current thinking step (if empty, will be generated by Gemini) - next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end - thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed) - total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down) - is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking - revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered - branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point - branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any) - needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed - metaComments: Meta-commentary from Gemini about its reasoning process - confidenceLevel: Gemini's confidence in the generated thought (0-1) - alternativePaths: Alternative approaches suggested by Gemini Session commands: - sessionCommand: Command to manage sessions ('save', 'load', 'getState') - sessionPath: Path to save or load the session file (required for 'save' and 'load' commands) You should: 1. Start with a clear query and any relevant context 2. Let Gemini generate thoughts by not providing the 'thought' parameter 3. Review the generated thoughts and meta-commentary 4. Feel free to revise or branch thoughts as needed 5. Consider alternative paths suggested by Gemini 6. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done 7. Use session commands to save your progress and resume later"

You have to retrieve the full note content by calling `read-note`. Here are tips to specify keywords effectively: ## Use special qualifiers to narrow down results You can use special qualifiers to get more accurate results. See the qualifiers and their usage examples: - **book** `book:Blog`: Searches for notes in the 'Blog' notebook. `book:\"Desktop App\"`: Searches for notes in the 'Desktop App' notebook. - **bookId** `bookId:kGlLniaV`: Searches for notes in the notebook ID 'book:kGlLniaV'. - **tag** `tag:JavaScript`: Searches for all notes having the 'JavaScript' tag. Read more about [tags](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/write-notes#tag-notes). - **status** `status:onHold`: Searches for all notes with the 'On hold' status. Read more about [statuses](/reference/note-statuses). - **title** `title:\"JavaScript setTimeout\"`: Searches for the note with the specified title. - **body** `body:KEYWORD`: Searches for a specific word in all notes. Equivalent to a [global search](#search-for-notes-across-all-notebooks). ### Combine qualifiers You can combine the filter qualifiers to refine data even more. **Find notes that contain the word 'Hello' and have the 'Issue' tag.** ```text Hello tag:Issue ``` **Find notes that contain the word 'Typescript,' have the 'Contribution' tag, and the 'Completed' status** ```text Typescript tag:Contribution status:Completed ``` ## Search for text with spaces To find the text that includes spaces, put the text into the double quotation marks (\"): ```text \"database associations\" ``` ## Exclude text from search To exclude text from the search results or ignore a specific qualifier, put the minus sign (-) before it. You can also combine the exclusions. See the examples: - `-book:Backend \"closure functions\"`: Ignores the 'Backend' notebook while searching for the 'closure functions' phrase. - `-tag:JavaScript`: Ignores all notes having the 'JavaScript' tag. - `-book:Typescript tag:work \"Data types\"`: Ignores the 'Typescript' notebook and the 'work' tag while searching for the 'Data types' phrase. - `-status:dropped title:\"Sprint 10.0\" debounce`: Ignores notes with the 'Dropped' status while searching for the 'debounce' word in the note with the 'Sprint 10.0' title. - `-\"Phrase to ignore\" \"in the rest of a sentence\"`: Ignores the 'Phrase to ignore' part while searching for 'in the rest of a sentence'. Note that you can't specify excluding modifiers only without including conditions. **WARNING**: Make sure to enter a text to search for after the exclusion modifier. - ✅ Will work `-book:Backend \"closure functions\"` - ⛔️ Won't work `-book:Backend`. There's no query. Inkdrop doesn't understand what to search for."

When to use this tool: - Breaking down complex medical problems into steps - Planning and designing treatment approaches with room for revision - Clinical analysis that might need course correction - Medical problems where the full scope might not be clear initially - Healthcare decisions that require a multi-step solution - Medical evaluations that need to maintain context over multiple steps - Situations where irrelevant medical information needs to be filtered out Key features: - You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as the diagnosis progresses - You can question or revise previous medical assessments - You can add more diagnostic thoughts as new information emerges - You can express clinical uncertainty and explore alternative approaches - Not every medical assessment needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack - Generates a clinical hypothesis - Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps - Repeats the process until a satisfactory diagnosis or treatment plan is reached - Provides a correct medical assessment or recommendation"

For the detected number: - 1 face: fixed crop ratio of (16,8); - 2 faces: fixed crop ratio of (8,9) (vertical concatenation); - 4 faces: fixed crop ratio of (16,9) (2x2 grid; the collage also has a 16:9 ratio). For each face track: 1. Traverse non-null bounding boxes. For each bbox, compute: bw = (x2 - x1) * scale, bh = (y2 - y1) * scale Calculate candidate sizes that strictly conform to the aspect ratio: candidate_h = ceil( max(bh, (bw * b) / a) ) candidate_w = round(a * candidate_h / b) (Here, the aspect_ratio is reduced to coprime form (a, b); then a and b are swapped for calculation convenience.) 2. Take the median of candidate sizes to obtain (med_w, med_h). Let t = med_h / b, then target_size = (round(a*t), round(b*t)). 3. Use the median target_size among all face tracks as the global target_per_person_size. Then process the full video frame by frame: - For each face, use interpolate_bbox to get the current bbox. - Based on the bbox center, compute a \"dynamic crop size\" (using the same candidate formula). - Crop the frame with dynamic crop area (adjust boundaries if needed), then resize the result to the global target_per_person_size. - Concatenate the face images per the layout (1: single; 2: vertical; 4: 2x2) and write the collage frame. After processing, add audio to the collage video and upload the final video to the provided GCS save_dir. If the number of detected faces is not 1, 2, or 4, return an empty string."

Invocation Notes: To use this tool correctly, the agent should provide the specific camera identifier or location name.

      "description": "# MCP RDKit Project ## Overview The `mcp_rdkit` project integrates the RDKit library with the MCP (Model Context Protocol) framework to provide advanced chemical informatics tools. It includes functionalities for molecular visualization, descriptor calculation, and interaction with an MCP server. ## Features - **Molecular Visualization**: Generate images of molecules using RDKit. - **Descriptor Calculation**: Compute molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, logP, and more. - **MCP Server Integration**: Communicate with an MCP server for advanced chemical informatics tasks. ## Project Structure - `mcp_rdkit/` - `__main__.py`: Entry point for the application. It initializes the MCP server and runs it in \"stdio\" mode. - `rdkit_helper.py`: Contains helper functions for RDKit operations, including: - Converting PIL images to base64. - Interfacing with the MCP server. - Utilizing RDKit for chemical computations. - `setup.py`: Configuration for packaging and distribution. ## Requirements - Python 3.8 or higher - RDKit library - MCP framework ## Installation 1. Install the package using pip: ```bash pip install mcp-rdkit ``` 2. Run the application: ```bash python -m mcp_rdkit ``` ## Demo You can integrate this directly into Claude App: ![Demo 1](uploads/image.png) ![Demo 2](uploads/image%20(1).png) ![Demo 3](uploads/image%20(2).png) ## Usage - **Run the MCP server**: The application starts an MCP server that can process chemical informatics tasks. - **Generate molecular images**: Use the RDKit helper functions to visualize molecules. - **Calculate descriptors**: Leverage RDKit's descriptor calculation tools for chemical analysis. ## MCP Configuration Example To use the RDKit server with MCP, add the following configuration to your `mcp` config file: ```json \"rdkit-server\": { \"type\": \"stdio\", \"command\": \"python\", \"args\": [ \"-m\", \"mcp_rdkit\" ] } ```",

It communicates with a Chrome extension via the WebSocket protocol to achieve precise browser control. Compared to traditional browser automation tools like Puppeteer or Playwright, CodingBaby Browser-Use MCP offers several advantages: 1. Higher Privileges: Running as a Chrome extension provides higher browser privileges. 2. Anti-Bot Evasion: Uses a real Chrome browser and user session, effectively bypassing many website anti-bot mechanisms. 3. Closer to Real User Behavior: Operations mimic real user interactions, reducing the likelihood of detection. 4. Session Persistence: Can maintain login states and cookies, facilitating access to authenticated pages. 5. Lightweight Deployment: Only requires installing the extension in the browser, eliminating the need for separate browser instances or WebDrivers.",

The image reflects the current scene in the camera's field of view and serves as a contextual input source for downstream tasks such as object recognition, anomaly detection, incident investigation, or situational assessment. When invoked, the tool provides the following: • Visual Scene Capture: A high-resolution image of what the camera is actively observing, including people, vehicles, license plates, and any detectable objects. • Scene Context: Metadata such as camera ID, location name, timestamp, and motion detection status if available. • Enriched Data Potential: The image can be paired with AI models or downstream analytics to extract insights such as: • Number and type of objects in frame (e.g., humans, cars, packages) • Unusual behaviors (e.g., loitering, unauthorized access) • Environmental conditions (e.g., lighting, obstruction, cleanliness) Use Cases: • Verify what triggered a motion alert or analytic rule. • Provide visual context for access events or alarms. • Support live incident triage or retrospective investigations. • Feed contextual imagery to agents making security or operational decisions. Invocation Notes: To use this tool correctly, the agent should provide the specific camera identifier or location name. If possible, include the intent (e.g., \"verify unauthorized access\", \"identify vehicle\", \"check for obstructions\") to enhance downstream processing or summarization."

          "description": "A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts. This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve. Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens. It uses an Agno multi-agent team (in coordinate mode) to process each thought, where a Coordinator delegates sub-tasks to specialists (Planner, Researcher, Analyzer, Critic, Synthesizer) and synthesizes their outputs. When to use this tool: - Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps. - Planning and design processes requiring iterative refinement and revision. - Complex analysis where the approach might need course correction based on findings. - Problems where the full scope or optimal path is not clear initially. - Situations requiring a multi-step solution with context maintained across steps. - Tasks where focusing on relevant information and filtering out noise is crucial. - Developing and verifying solution hypotheses through a chain of reasoning. Key features & usage guidelines: - The process is driven by the caller (e.g., an LLM) making sequential calls to this tool. - Start with an initial estimate for `totalThoughts`, but adjust it dynamically via subsequent calls if needed. - Use `isRevision=True` and `revisesThought` to explicitly revisit and correct previous steps. - Use `branchFromThought` and `branchId` to explore alternative paths or perspectives. - If the estimated `totalThoughts` is reached but more steps are needed, set `needsMoreThoughts=True` on the *last* thought within the current estimate to signal the need for extension. - Express uncertainty and explore alternatives within the `thought` content. - Generate solution hypotheses within the `thought` content when appropriate. - Verify hypotheses in subsequent `thought` steps based on the reasoning chain. - The caller should repeat the process, calling this tool for each step, until a satisfactory solution is reached. - Set `nextThoughtNeeded=False` only when the caller determines the process is complete and a final answer is ready. Parameters: thought (str): The content of the current thinking step. This can be an analytical step, a plan, a question, a critique, a revision, a hypothesis, or verification. Make it specific enough to imply the desired action. thoughtNumber (int): The sequence number of this thought (>=1). Can exceed initial `totalThoughts` if the process is extended. totalThoughts (int): The current *estimate* of the total thoughts required for the process. This can be adjusted by the caller in subsequent calls. Minimum 5 suggested. nextThoughtNeeded (bool): Indicates if the caller intends to make another call to this tool after the current one. Set to False only when the entire process is deemed complete. isRevision (bool, optional): True if this thought revises or corrects a previous thought. Defaults to False. revisesThought (int, optional): The `thoughtNumber` of the thought being revised, required if `isRevision` is True. Must be less than the current `thoughtNumber`. branchFromThought (int, optional): The `thoughtNumber` from which this thought branches to explore an alternative path. Defaults to None. branchId (str, optional): A unique identifier for the branch being explored, required if `branchFromThought` is set. Defaults to None. needsMoreThoughts (bool, optional): Set to True on a thought if the caller anticipates needing more steps beyond the current `totalThoughts` estimate *after* this thought. Defaults to False. Returns: str: The Coordinator agent's synthesized response based on specialist contributions for the current `thought`. Includes guidance for the caller on potential next steps (e.g., suggestions for revision or branching based on the specialists' analysis). The caller uses this response to formulate the *next* thought."

Unlike traditional sequential thinking, this tool enables more powerful problem solving by allowing atomic units of thought to form dependencies with each other. When to use: - Solving problems requiring complex reasoning - Generating hypotheses that need verification from multiple perspectives - Deriving high-confidence conclusions in scenarios where accuracy is crucial - Minimizing logical errors in critical tasks - Decision-making requiring multiple verification steps Atom types: - premise: Basic assumptions or given information for problem solving - reasoning: Logical reasoning process based on other atoms - hypothesis: Proposed solutions or intermediate conclusions - verification: Process to evaluate the validity of other atoms (especially hypotheses) - conclusion: Verified hypotheses or final problem solutions Parameter descriptions: - atomId: Unique identifier for the atom (e.g., 'A1', 'H2') - content: Actual content of the atom - atomType: Type of atom (one of: premise, reasoning, hypothesis, verification, conclusion) - dependencies: List of IDs of other atoms this atom depends on - confidence: Confidence level of this atom (value between 0-1) - isVerified: Whether this atom has been verified - depth: Depth level of this atom (in the decomposition-contraction process) Additional features: 1. Decomposition-Contraction mechanism: - Decompose atoms into smaller sub-atoms and contract back after verification - startDecomposition(atomId): Start atom decomposition - addToDecomposition(decompositionId, atomId): Add sub-atom to decomposition - completeDecomposition(decompositionId): Complete decomposition process 2. Automatic termination mechanism: - Automatically terminate when reaching maximum depth or finding high-confidence conclusion - getTerminationStatus(): Return termination status and reason - getBestConclusion(): Return highest confidence conclusion Usage method: 1. Understand the problem and define necessary premise atoms 2. Create reasoning atoms based on premises 3. Create hypothesis atoms based on reasoning 4. Create verification atoms to verify hypotheses 5. Derive conclusion atoms based on verified hypotheses 6. Use atom decomposition to explore deeper when necessary 7. Present the high-confidence conclusion atom as the final answer"
