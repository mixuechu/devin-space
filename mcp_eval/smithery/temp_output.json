Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens. When to use this tool: - Breaking down complex problems into steps - Planning and design with room for revision - Analysis that might need course correction - Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially - Problems that require a multi-step solution - Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps - Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out Key features: - You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress - You can question or revise previous thoughts - You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end - You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches - Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack - Generates a solution hypothesis - Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps - Repeats the process until satisfied - Provides a correct answer Parameters explained: - thought: Your current thinking step, which can include: * Regular analytical steps * Revisions of previous thoughts * Questions about previous decisions * Realizations about needing more analysis * Changes in approach * Hypothesis generation * Hypothesis verification - next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end - thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed) - total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down) - is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking - revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered - branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point - branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any) - needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed You should: 1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust 2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts 3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\" 4. Express uncertainty when present 5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths 6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step 7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate 8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps 9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution 10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output 11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached"

WRITE Operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE): - Require UNSAFE mode (use live_dangerously('database', True) first) - Example: INSERT INTO public.users (email) VALUES ('user@example.com'); 3. SCHEMA Operations (CREATE, ALTER, DROP): - Require UNSAFE mode (use live_dangerously('database', True) first) - Destructive operations (DROP, TRUNCATE) require additional confirmation - Example: CREATE TABLE public.test_table (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT); MIGRATION HANDLING: All queries that modify the database will be automatically version controlled by the server. You can provide optional migration name, if you want to name the migration. - Respect the following format: verb_noun_detail. Be descriptive and concise. - Examples: - create_users_table - add_email_to_profiles - enable_rls_on_users - If you don't provide a migration name, the server will generate one based on the SQL statement - The system will sanitize your provided name to ensure compatibility with database systems - Migration names are prefixed with a timestamp in the format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS SAFETY SYSTEM: Operations are categorized by risk level: - LOW RISK: Read operations (SELECT, EXPLAIN) - allowed in SAFE mode - MEDIUM RISK: Write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) - require UNSAFE mode - HIGH RISK: Schema operations (CREATE, ALTER) - require UNSAFE mode - EXTREME RISK: Destructive operations (DROP, TRUNCATE) - require UNSAFE mode and confirmation TRANSACTION HANDLING: - DO NOT use transaction control statements (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK) - The database client automatically wraps queries in transactions - The SQL validator will reject queries containing transaction control statements - This ensures atomicity and provides rollback capability for data modifications MULTIPLE STATEMENTS: - You can send multiple SQL statements in a single query - Each statement will be executed in order within the same transaction - Example: CREATE TABLE public.test_table (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT); INSERT INTO public.test_table (name) VALUES ('test'); CONFIRMATION FLOW FOR HIGH-RISK OPERATIONS: - High-risk operations (DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE, etc.) will be rejected with a confirmation ID - The error message will explain what happened and provide a confirmation ID - Review the risks with the user before proceeding - Use the confirm_destructive_operation tool with the provided ID to execute the operation IMPORTANT GUIDELINES: - The database client starts in SAFE mode by default for safety - Only enable UNSAFE mode when you need to modify data or schema - Never mix READ and WRITE operations in the same transaction - For destructive operations, be prepared to confirm with the confirm_destructive_operation tool WHEN TO USE OTHER TOOLS INSTEAD: - For Auth operations (users, authentication, etc.): Use call_auth_admin_method instead of direct SQL The Auth Admin SDK provides safer, validated methods for user management - For project configuration, functions, storage, etc.: Use send_management_api_request The Management API handles Supabase platform features that aren't directly in the database Note: This tool operates on the PostgreSQL database only.

If cross-domain work is required, split it into multiple subtasks. - ### **Recommended Number of Tasks** Avoid splitting into more than **10 subtasks** at once. If more are needed, submit them in prioritized batches (6–8 tasks per batch). - ### **Recommended Task Length** Each split should not exceed **5,000 characters**. If it does, divide and submit in multiple batches. - ### **Depth Limitation** The task tree should not exceed **3 levels**: - **Level 1**: Functional Modules - **Level 2**: Main Processes - **Level 3**: Key Steps ## 2. **Task Splitting Example** - Identify **core functionality points**, and create a subtask for each. - Annotate each subtask with: - **Input/Output** - **Acceptance Criteria** - If needed, provide **pseudocode**: - Only outline high-level logic and key steps. - Avoid providing complete source code. - Check **dependencies** between subtasks and specify them in the `dependencies` field. - If the task involves interface design, always provide a complete and consistent definition, including: - Function/class/schema definitions (including names, parameters, return values) - Data types, usage descriptions, and optional/required status for each item - Error handling methods and expected exception scenarios - Dependency and naming conventions (if any) - Sample data and usage examples This ensures consistency, readability, and development precision between tasks. ## 3. **Dependencies and Prioritization** - Mark each subtask with its `dependencies` list. - Automatically compute and enforce execution order based on the dependency graph to prioritize the **critical path**. ## 4. **Update Mode Explanation (`updateMode`)** When you need to create a new task that is not related to the current task list, be sure to use `clearAllTasks` to avoid task confusion. - `append`: Keep existing unfinished tasks and add new ones. - `overwrite`: Delete all unfinished tasks, keep completed ones. - `selective`: Smart-match and update tasks by name. - `clearAllTasks`: Clear all tasks and automatically back up the current list. --- ## 5. **Strict JSON Rules** - ### **No Comments Allowed** JSON does not support comments. Any use of `#` or `//` will cause parsing failures. - ### **Proper Escaping Required** All special characters (e.g., double quotes `\\\"`, backslashes `\\\\`) must be properly escaped, or they will be considered invalid. ## 6. **Important Notes** These tasks will be executed by low-intelligence models, so please follow the guidelines below: - `Clear and Explicit Instructions`: This prevents the model from producing incorrect or inconsistent architecture/code styles. Provide clear commands or specifications. - `Encapsulated Interfaces`: Each task runs independently. Define the interfaces clearly — such as function names, parameters, return values — so that other task-executing models can easily understand how to interact with or integrate these functions. - `Dependencies`: If there are dependencies between tasks, define the interaction interfaces first. Tasks do not need to know each other's implementation, but must know how to interact with one another."

Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust 2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts 3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\" 4. Express uncertainty when present 5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths 6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step 7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate 8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps 9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution 10.

          "description": "A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts. This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve. Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens. IMPORTANT: When initializing this tool, you must pass all available tools that you want the sequential thinking process to be able to use. The tool will analyze these tools and provide recommendations for their use. When to use this tool: - Breaking down complex problems into steps - Planning and design with room for revision - Analysis that might need course correction - Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially - Problems that require a multi-step solution - Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps - Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out - When you need guidance on which tools to use and in what order Key features: - You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress - You can question or revise previous thoughts - You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end - You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches - Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack - Generates a solution hypothesis - Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps - Recommends appropriate tools for each step - Provides rationale for tool recommendations - Suggests tool execution order and parameters - Tracks previous recommendations and remaining steps Parameters explained: - thought: Your current thinking step, which can include: * Regular analytical steps * Revisions of previous thoughts * Questions about previous decisions * Realizations about needing more analysis * Changes in approach * Hypothesis generation * Hypothesis verification * Tool recommendations and rationale - next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end - thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed) - total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down) - is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking - revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered - branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point - branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any) - needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed - current_step: Current step recommendation, including: * step_description: What needs to be done * recommended_tools: Tools recommended for this step * expected_outcome: What to expect from this step * next_step_conditions: Conditions to consider for the next step - previous_steps: Steps already recommended - remaining_steps: High-level descriptions of upcoming steps You should: 1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust 2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts 3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\" 4. Express uncertainty when present 5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths 6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step 7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate 8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps 9. Consider available tools that could help with the current step 10. Provide clear rationale for tool recommendations 11. Suggest specific tool parameters when appropriate 12. Consider alternative tools for each step 13. Track progress through the recommended steps 14. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output 15. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached"

When to use this tool: - Breaking down complex problems into steps - Planning and design with room for revision - Analysis that might need course correction - Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially - Problems that require a multi-step solution - Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps - Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out Key features: - Leverages Gemini AI for deep analytical thinking - Provides meta-commentary on the reasoning process - Indicates confidence levels for generated thoughts - Suggests alternative approaches when relevant - You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress - You can question or revise previous thoughts - You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end - You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches - Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack - Session persistence: save and resume your analysis sessions Parameters explained: - query: The question or problem to be analyzed - context: Additional context information (e.g., code snippets, background) - approach: Suggested approach to the problem (optional) - previousThoughts: Array of previous thoughts for context - thought: The current thinking step (if empty, will be generated by Gemini) - next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end - thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed) - total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down) - is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking - revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered - branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point - branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any) - needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed - metaComments: Meta-commentary from Gemini about its reasoning process - confidenceLevel: Gemini's confidence in the generated thought (0-1) - alternativePaths: Alternative approaches suggested by Gemini Session commands: - sessionCommand: Command to manage sessions ('save', 'load', 'getState') - sessionPath: Path to save or load the session file (required for 'save' and 'load' commands) You should: 1. Start with a clear query and any relevant context 2. Let Gemini generate thoughts by not providing the 'thought' parameter 3. Review the generated thoughts and meta-commentary 4. Feel free to revise or branch thoughts as needed 5. Consider alternative paths suggested by Gemini 6. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done 7. Use session commands to save your progress and resume later"

When to use this tool: - Breaking down complex problems into steps - Planning and design with room for revision - Analysis that might need course correction - Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially - Problems that require a multi-step solution - Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps - Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out Key features: - Leverages Gemini AI for deep analytical thinking - Provides meta-commentary on the reasoning process - Indicates confidence levels for generated thoughts - Suggests alternative approaches when relevant - You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress - You can question or revise previous thoughts - You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end - You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches - Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack - Session persistence: save and resume your analysis sessions Parameters explained: - query: The question or problem to be analyzed - context: Additional context information (e.g., code snippets, background) - approach: Suggested approach to the problem (optional) - previousThoughts: Array of previous thoughts for context - thought: The current thinking step (if empty, will be generated by Gemini) - next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end - thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed) - total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down) - is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking - revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered - branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point - branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any) - needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed - metaComments: Meta-commentary from Gemini about its reasoning process - confidenceLevel: Gemini's confidence in the generated thought (0-1) - alternativePaths: Alternative approaches suggested by Gemini Session commands: - sessionCommand: Command to manage sessions ('save', 'load', 'getState') - sessionPath: Path to save or load the session file (required for 'save' and 'load' commands) You should: 1. Start with a clear query and any relevant context 2. Let Gemini generate thoughts by not providing the 'thought' parameter 3. Review the generated thoughts and meta-commentary 4. Feel free to revise or branch thoughts as needed 5. Consider alternative paths suggested by Gemini 6. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done 7. give realy realy long thinking results,like 1000words or something it should be a lot 7. give realy realy long thinking results,like 1000words or something it should be a lot 7. give realy realy long thinking results,like 1000words or something it should be a lot 8. Use session commands to save your progress and resume later"

Initial Opening <open> - Recognize the question's nature 2. Skillful Engagement <engage> - Choose appropriate methods 3. Transformation <transform> - Convert confusion to clarity 4. Natural Expression <express> - Allow understanding to flow 5. Final Integration <OUTPUT> - Present clear, beneficial response Parameters explained: - tag: The current processing technique (must be one of the core tags) - content: The content of the current processing step - stepNumber: Current number in sequence - totalSteps: Current estimate of steps needed - nextStepNeeded: Whether another step is needed - isMeditation: Whether this step is a meditative pause - meditationDuration: Optional duration for meditation Every inquiry concludes with a final <OUTPUT> tag containing the complete response."

      "description": "MCP fal.ai Image Server Effortlessly generate images from text prompts using fal.ai and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Integrates directly with AI IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf. ## When and Why to Use This tool is designed for: - Developers and designers who want to generate images from text prompts without leaving their IDE. - Rapid prototyping of UI concepts, marketing assets, or creative ideas. - Content creators needing unique visuals for blogs, presentations, or social media. - AI researchers and tinkerers experimenting with the latest fal.ai models. - Automating workflows that require programmatic image generation via MCP. Key features: - Supports any valid fal.ai model and all major image parameters. - Works out of the box with Node.js and a fal.ai API key. - Saves images locally with accessible file paths. - Simple configuration and robust error handling. ## Quick Start 1. Requirements: Node.js 18+, fal.ai API key 2. Configure MCP: { \"mcpServers\": { \"fal-ai-image\": { \"command\": \"npx\", \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-fal-ai-image\"], \"env\": { \"FAL_KEY\": \"YOUR-FAL-AI-API-KEY\" } } } } 3. Run: Use the generate-image tool from your IDE. 💡 Typical Workflow: Describe the image you want (e.g., “generate a landscape with flying cars using model fal-ai/kolors, 2 images, landscape_16_9”) and get instant results in your IDE. ### 🗨️ Example Prompts - generate an image of a red apple - generate an image of a red apple using model fal-ai/kolors - generate 3 images of a glowing red apple in a futuristic city using model fal-ai/recraft-v3, square_hd, 40 inference steps, guidance scale 4.0, safety checker on Supported parameters: prompt, model ID (any fal.ai model), number of images, image size, inference steps, guidance scale, safety checker. Images are saved locally; file paths are shown in the response. For model IDs, see fal.ai/models. ## Troubleshooting - FAL_KEY environment variable is not set: Set your fal.ai API key as above. - npx not found: Install Node.js 18+ and npm. Advanced: Example MCP Request/Response Request: { \"tool\": \"generate-image\", \"args\": { \"prompt\": \"A futuristic cityscape at sunset\", \"model\": \"fal-ai/kolors\" } } Example response: { \"images\": [ { \"url\": \"file:///path/to/generated_image1.png\" }, { \"url\": \"file:///path/to/generated_image2.png\" } ] } ## 📁 Image Output Directory Generated images are saved to your local system: - By default: ~/Downloads/fal_ai (on Linux/macOS; uses XDG standard if available) - Custom location: Set the environment variable FAL_IMAGES_OUTPUT_DIR to your desired folder. Images will be saved in /fal_ai. The full file path for each image is included in the tool's response. ## ⚠️ Error Handling & Troubleshooting - If you specify a model ID that is not supported by fal.ai, you will receive an error from the backend. Double-check for typos or visit fal.ai/models to confirm the model ID. - For the latest list of models and their capabilities, refer to the fal.ai model catalog or API docs. - For other errors, consult your MCP client logs or open an issue on GitHub. ## 🤝 Contributing Contributions and suggestions are welcome! Please open issues or pull requests on GitHub. ## 🔒 Security - Your API key is only used locally to authenticate with fal.ai. - No user data is stored or transmitted except as required by fal.ai API. ## 🛡 License MIT License © 2025 Madhusudan Kulkarni",

WHEN NOT TO USE: - When you already know the specific space ID/key (use 'get_space' instead). - When you need to search for page content (use 'search' instead). - When you need to list pages within a known space (use 'list_pages' instead). - When you need detailed information about a specific space (use 'get_space' instead). RETURNS: Formatted list of spaces including: - Numeric ID (used for most API operations) - Space key (short identifier, e.g., 'DEV', 'HR', etc.) - Display name and description - Type (global, personal) and status (current, archived) - Creation information and URL Results can be paginated using the 'limit' and 'cursor' parameters. SORTING: By default, spaces are sorted by name in descending order. EXAMPLES: - List all spaces: {} - Filter by type: { type: [\"global\"] } - Filter by status: { status: [\"current\"] } - Search by name: { query: \"Engineering\" } - With pagination: { limit: 20, cursor: \"some-cursor-value\" } ERRORS: - Authentication failures: Check Confluence credentials. - Permission issues: Ensure you have access to view spaces. - Invalid filter values: Verify type/status values match allowed options. - No spaces found: May indicate permission issues or overly restrictive filters."

Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust 2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts 3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\" 4. Express uncertainty when present 5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths 6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step 7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate 8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps 9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution 10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output 11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached"

Default is 10. You can increase this to retrieve more articles in one call (e.g. limit: 20 for 20 articles). Note that higher limits will consume additional credits (see Rate Limits & Credits). If you only want a small number of the latest articles, you can set a smaller limit as well. offset(number, optional): The offset of the news to fetch. Default is 0. This is used for pagination. For example, to get the second page of results when using a limit of 10, you would set offset: 10 (skip the first 10 articles, return the next set). Similarly, offset: 20 would fetch the third page (items 21–30), and so on. fetchAfter(Datetime, optional): The date after which to fetch the news. Provide a JavaScript Date object or a date string (which will be interpreted in UTC by the API). For example, fetchAfter: new Date('2024-01-01') will fetch news items published from January 1, 2024 onward. This is useful for getting news within a certain time range (e.g., only recent news). sortBy(string, optional): The field by which to sort the news. Currently, the only supported sort key is 'createdAt', which corresponds to the article's publication time. By default, results are sorted by newest (most recent) first. If not provided, the SDK will sort by createdAt descending. (At this time, no other sort fields are supported.) Returns: The response from ChainGPT AI to the provided question or message."

File Paths - EXPLICIT REQUIREMENTS: * When asked to save or convert to a file, you MUST provide: - Complete directory path - Filename - File extension * Example request: 'Write a story and save as PDF' * You MUST specify: '/path/to/story.pdf' or 'C:\\Documents\\story.pdf' * The tool will NOT automatically generate filenames or extensions 3. File Location After Conversion: * After successful conversion, the tool will display the exact path where the file is saved * Look for message: 'Content successfully converted and saved to: [file_path]' * You can find your converted file at the specified location * If no path is specified, files may be saved in system temp directory (/tmp/ on Unix systems) * For better control, always provide explicit output file paths Supported formats: - Basic formats: txt, html, markdown - Advanced formats (REQUIRE complete file paths): pdf, docx, rst, latex, epub ✅ CORRECT Usage Examples: 1. 'Convert this text to HTML' (basic conversion) - Tool will show converted content 2. 'Save this text as PDF at /documents/story.pdf' - Correct: specifies path + filename + extension - Tool will show: 'Content successfully converted and saved to: /documents/story.pdf' ❌ INCORRECT Usage Examples: 1. 'Save this as PDF in /documents/' - Missing filename and extension 2. 'Convert to PDF' - Missing complete file path When requesting conversion, ALWAYS specify: 1. The content or input file 2. The desired output format 3. For advanced formats: complete output path + filename + extension Example: 'Convert this markdown to PDF and save as /path/to/output.pdf' Note: After conversion, always check the success message for the exact file location."
