      "description": "MCP fal.ai Image Server Effortlessly generate images from text prompts using fal.ai and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Integrates directly with AI IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf. ## When and Why to Use This tool is designed for: - Developers and designers who want to generate images from text prompts without leaving their IDE. - Rapid prototyping of UI concepts, marketing assets, or creative ideas. - Content creators needing unique visuals for blogs, presentations, or social media. - AI researchers and tinkerers experimenting with the latest fal.ai models. - Automating workflows that require programmatic image generation via MCP. Key features: - Supports any valid fal.ai model and all major image parameters. - Works out of the box with Node.js and a fal.ai API key. - Saves images locally with accessible file paths. - Simple configuration and robust error handling. ## Quick Start 1. Requirements: Node.js 18+, fal.ai API key 2. Configure MCP: { \"mcpServers\": { \"fal-ai-image\": { \"command\": \"npx\", \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-fal-ai-image\"], \"env\": { \"FAL_KEY\": \"YOUR-FAL-AI-API-KEY\" } } } } 3. Run: Use the generate-image tool from your IDE. üí° Typical Workflow: Describe the image you want (e.g., ‚Äúgenerate a landscape with flying cars using model fal-ai/kolors, 2 images, landscape_16_9‚Äù) and get instant results in your IDE. ### üó®Ô∏è Example Prompts - generate an image of a red apple - generate an image of a red apple using model fal-ai/kolors - generate 3 images of a glowing red apple in a futuristic city using model fal-ai/recraft-v3, square_hd, 40 inference steps, guidance scale 4.0, safety checker on Supported parameters: prompt, model ID (any fal.ai model), number of images, image size, inference steps, guidance scale, safety checker. Images are saved locally; file paths are shown in the response. For model IDs, see fal.ai/models. ## Troubleshooting - FAL_KEY environment variable is not set: Set your fal.ai API key as above. - npx not found: Install Node.js 18+ and npm. Advanced: Example MCP Request/Response Request: { \"tool\": \"generate-image\", \"args\": { \"prompt\": \"A futuristic cityscape at sunset\", \"model\": \"fal-ai/kolors\" } } Example response: { \"images\": [ { \"url\": \"file:///path/to/generated_image1.png\" }, { \"url\": \"file:///path/to/generated_image2.png\" } ] } ## üìÅ Image Output Directory Generated images are saved to your local system: - By default: ~/Downloads/fal_ai (on Linux/macOS; uses XDG standard if available) - Custom location: Set the environment variable FAL_IMAGES_OUTPUT_DIR to your desired folder. Images will be saved in /fal_ai. The full file path for each image is included in the tool's response. ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling & Troubleshooting - If you specify a model ID that is not supported by fal.ai, you will receive an error from the backend. Double-check for typos or visit fal.ai/models to confirm the model ID. - For the latest list of models and their capabilities, refer to the fal.ai model catalog or API docs. - For other errors, consult your MCP client logs or open an issue on GitHub. ## ü§ù Contributing Contributions and suggestions are welcome! Please open issues or pull requests on GitHub. ## üîí Security - Your API key is only used locally to authenticate with fal.ai. - No user data is stored or transmitted except as required by fal.ai API. ## üõ° License MIT License ¬© 2025 Madhusudan Kulkarni",

It includes functionalities for molecular visualization, descriptor calculation, and interaction with an MCP server. ## Features - **Molecular Visualization**: Generate images of molecules using RDKit. - **Descriptor Calculation**: Compute molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, logP, and more. - **MCP Server Integration**: Communicate with an MCP server for advanced chemical informatics tasks. ## Project Structure - `mcp_rdkit/` - `__main__.py`: Entry point for the application. It initializes the MCP server and runs it in \"stdio\" mode. - `rdkit_helper.py`: Contains helper functions for RDKit operations, including: - Converting PIL images to base64. - Interfacing with the MCP server. - Utilizing RDKit for chemical computations. - `setup.py`: Configuration for packaging and distribution. ## Requirements - Python 3.8 or higher - RDKit library - MCP framework ## Installation 1. Install the package using pip: ```bash pip install mcp-rdkit ``` 2. Run the application: ```bash python -m mcp_rdkit ``` ## Demo You can integrate this directly into Claude App: ![Demo 1](uploads/image.png) ![Demo 2](uploads/image%20(1).png) ![Demo 3](uploads/image%20(2).png) ## Usage - **Run the MCP server**: The application starts an MCP server that can process chemical informatics tasks. - **Generate molecular images**: Use the RDKit helper functions to visualize molecules. - **Calculate descriptors**: Leverage RDKit's descriptor calculation tools for chemical analysis. ## MCP Configuration Example To use the RDKit server with MCP, add the following configuration to your `mcp` config file: ```json \"rdkit-server\": { \"type\": \"stdio\", \"command\": \"python\", \"args\": [ \"-m\", \"mcp_rdkit\" ] } ```",

Compared to traditional browser automation tools like Puppeteer or Playwright, CodingBaby Browser-Use MCP offers several advantages: 1. Higher Privileges: Running as a Chrome extension provides higher browser privileges. 2. Anti-Bot Evasion: Uses a real Chrome browser and user session, effectively bypassing many website anti-bot mechanisms. 3. Closer to Real User Behavior: Operations mimic real user interactions, reducing the likelihood of detection. 4. Session Persistence: Can maintain login states and cookies, facilitating access to authenticated pages. 5. Lightweight Deployment: Only requires installing the extension in the browser, eliminating the need for separate browser instances or WebDrivers.",
